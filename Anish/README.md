Not working atm

some way of algo using functions defined by itself

annotate functions with inputs/output types
-> intelligence to remember/understand how it works rather than just apply the functions in dfs fashion

genetic algos are very random
-> better mutations can get overshadowed by worse mutations due to chance
-> perhaps some weighting to which parent's gene takes priority?
    -> if parent1 has a score 10% better than parent2, then parent1's genes have 10% better chance to be passed onto child
    -> side effects may be funneling into local min instead of global min

Greater population size results in optimal solutions occurrences far more than # of generations
